This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Tcl related to the order of arguments in procedures when performing numerical comparisons.  The `check_range` procedure is designed to validate if a value falls within a specified range. However, due to Tcl's flexible argument handling, it fails when the minimum value is greater than the maximum value. This README explains the issue, provides a failing code example, and presents a solution to enforce correct argument order and improve robustness.
